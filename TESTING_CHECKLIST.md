## üéØ Manual Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Service Health ‚úÖ

```bash
# Test all health endpoints
curl http://localhost:3001/up  # Customer Service
curl http://localhost:3002/up  # Invoice Service
curl http://localhost:3003/up  # Audit Service
```

**Expected**: All return `200 OK`

- [ ] Customer Service health check passes
- [ ] Invoice Service health check passes
- [ ] Audit Service health check passes

### Phase 2: Database Setup ‚úÖ

```bash
# Create databases and run migrations
docker exec factumarket-customer-service rails db:create db:migrate
docker exec factumarket-invoice-service rails db:create db:migrate

# Load seed data
docker exec factumarket-customer-service rails db:seed
```

**Expected**: 5 customers created

- [ ] Customer database created
- [ ] Invoice database created
- [ ] Migrations executed successfully
- [ ] Seed data loaded (5 customers)

### Phase 3: Authentication ‚úÖ

```bash
# Generate JWT token
TOKEN=$(docker exec factumarket-customer-service rails runner "require 'jwt'; puts JWT.encode({user_id: 1, email: 'admin@factumarket.com', exp: (Time.now + 86400).to_i}, 'factumarket_secret_key_2025', 'HS256')")

echo $TOKEN
export TOKEN
```

**Expected**: Token string displayed

- [ ] JWT token generated successfully
- [ ] Token exported to environment variable

### Phase 4: Customer Service (MVC) ‚úÖ

```bash
# Test 1: List customers
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/clientes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq

# Test 2: Create customer
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/clientes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer": {
      "name": "Test Company",
      "identification": "TEST-001",
      "email": "test@company.com",
      "address": "Test Address"
    }
  }' | jq

# Test 3: Get specific customer
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/clientes/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] List customers returns 5+ customers
- [ ] Create customer succeeds (returns ID)
- [ ] Get customer by ID returns correct data
- [ ] Request without token returns 401 Unauthorized

### Phase 5: Invoice Service (Clean Architecture) ‚úÖ

```bash
# Test 1: Create valid invoice
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/facturas \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "invoice": {
      "customer_id": 1,
      "amount": 1000000,
      "emission_date": "2025-10-20"
    }
  }' | jq

# Test 2: Validation - Negative amount (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/facturas \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "invoice": {
      "customer_id": 1,
      "amount": -500,
      "emission_date": "2025-10-20"
    }
  }' | jq

# Test 3: Validation - Future date (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/facturas \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "invoice": {
      "customer_id": 1,
      "amount": 1000,
      "emission_date": "2026-12-31"
    }
  }' | jq

# Test 4: Inter-service validation - Invalid customer (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/facturas \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "invoice": {
      "customer_id": 9999,
      "amount": 1000,
      "emission_date": "2025-10-20"
    }
  }' | jq

# Test 5: Get invoice
curl -X GET http://localhost:3002/facturas/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq

# Test 6: List invoices by date range
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3002/facturas?fechaInicio=2025-10-01&fechaFin=2025-10-31" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Valid invoice created successfully
- [ ] Tax calculated correctly (19% of amount)
- [ ] Total = amount + tax

- [ ] List invoices by date range works

### Phase 6: Audit Service (Event-Driven) ‚úÖ

```bash
# Wait for events to be processed
sleep 5

# Test 1: List all audit events

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq

# Test 2: Filter by entity type
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3003/auditoria?entity_type=Invoice" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq

# Test 3: Filter by service
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3003/auditoria?service=invoice_service" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq

# Test 4: Get audit trail for specific invoice
curl -X GET http://localhost:3003/auditoria/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Audit events exist (count > 0)
- [ ] Events include: customer.created, invoice.created, etc.
- [ ] Filter by entity_type works
- [ ] Filter by service works
- [ ] Invoice-specific audit trail retrieved

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Problem: PostgreSQL not ready

**Solution**: Wait a few seconds and check status:
```bash
docker exec factumarket-postgres pg_isready -U postgres
docker-compose logs postgres
```

### Problem: Migrations failing

**Solution**: Run manually:
```bash
docker exec factumarket-customer-service rails db:create db:migrate
docker exec factumarket-invoice-service rails db:create db:migrate
```

### Problem: Events not reaching Audit Service

**Solution**: Check RabbitMQ and Event Consumer:
```bash
docker-compose logs rabbitmq
docker-compose logs audit-service | grep "Event Consumer"
```

### Problem: JWT token expired

**Solution**: Generate new token:
```bash
TOKEN=$(docker exec factumarket-customer-service rails runner "require 'jwt'; puts JWT.encode({user_id: 1, email: 'admin@factumarket.com', exp: (Time.now + 86400).to_i}, 'factumarket_secret_key_2025', 'HS256')")
export TOKEN
```
